 *
 * The available profiles are the set of MOJOSHADER_PROFILE_* defines.
 *  Note that MojoShader may be built without support for all listed
 *  profiles (in which case using one here will return with an error).
 *

 *  out of memory upon entry (in which case, this function returns a static
 *  MOJOSHADER_parseData object, which is still safe to pass to
 *  MOJOSHADER_freeParseData()).
 *
 * You can force the shader to expect samplers of certain types. Generally
 *  you don't need this, as Shader Model 2 and later always specify what they
 *  expect samplers to be (2D, cubemap, etc). Shader Model 1, however, just
 *  uses whatever is bound to a given sampler at draw time, but this doesn't
 *  work in OpenGL, etc. In these cases, MojoShader will default to
 *  2D texture sampling (or cubemap sampling, in cases where it makes sense,
 *  like the TEXM3X3TEX opcode), which works 75% of the time, but if you
 *  really needed something else, you'll need to specify it here. This can
 *  also be used, at your own risk, to override DCL opcodes in shaders: if
 *  the shader explicit says 2D, but you want Cubemap, for example, you can
 *  use this to override. If you aren't sure about any of this stuff, you can
 *  (and should) almost certainly ignore it: (smap) can be NULL.
 *
 * (bufsize) is the size in bytes of (tokenbuf). If (bufsize) is zero,
 *  MojoShader will attempt to figure out the size of the buffer, but you
 *  risk a buffer overflow if you have corrupt data, etc. Supply the value
 *  if you can.
 *
 * This function is thread safe, so long as (m) and (f) are too, and that
